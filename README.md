### Hi, my name is Nicolò <!--, known on the web as 'fenix'--> 👋
I'm into partecipating and contributing to communities and open source projects that share same interests, and where I can find my knowledge useful.  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on several personal projects involving [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and Godot Engine plugins
- :mortar_board: I graduated from the [Politecnico di Bari](http://www.poliba.it/) with a degree in Computer Science and Automation Engineering.
